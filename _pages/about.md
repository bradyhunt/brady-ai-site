I am a Research Scientist in the <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/optmed/about-us/laboratory-faculty/">Optics in Medicine</a> lab at Dartmouth, where I work on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lsm.23414">AI-powered imaging systems</a> for real-time treatment guidance in radiotherapy, surgery, and dermatology applications. I believe that <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/data-centric-ai">Data-centric AI</a> is the most promising pathway to achieve AI adoption in medicine. I seek to deeply understand how data (particularly image/video) informs decision making in both high- and low-resource healthcare settings and where AI-powered tools can be most transformative. I bridge multiple domains of engineering to bring sensors, data, ML and clincians together in conducting my research at the <a href="https://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/">Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center</a>.

Prior to joining Dartmouth, I completed my PhD in Bioengineering under the mentorship of <a href="https://kortum.rice.edu/people/rebecca-richards-kortum">Rebecca Richards-Kortum</a> at Rice University. At Rice, I led efforts to transform cervical cancer prevention using point-of-care imaging technologies in medically underserved populations. I was fortunate to spend time working in three different cancer centers in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.33543">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.basichealth.org/our-work/where-we-work/el-salvador/">El Salvador</a>, and <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/peerccspt/evaluating-innovative-technologies-and-approaches-to-addressing-cervical-cancer-in-the-republic-of-mozambique">Mozambique</a>. Prior to my work at Rice, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Biophysics <i>magna cum laude</i> from Brigham Young University.
